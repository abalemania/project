                    I am Ayeisha Alemania of 9-Pinatubo, Pisay CLC. I am known to my peers as Ai, which is pronounced "ah-yee". I am pansexual :D yeehaw!

                    What moved me to write this essay was the constant, undeserved, severe discrimination my fellow LGBTQ+ members receive. This is very much uncalled for and outright improper. We're all just humans who deserve and long to love like all other people.

                <p>
                
                    I hope that this essay will serve as inspiration or reality check to those who will read it!
