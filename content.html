                       What really is the problem with people who are against gay people? It’s not like the gays are the only bible-criteria sinners. It’s obviously not like it’s the bachelor with the skull tattoo who gets blackout drunk and pays for sexual pleasure at the Angeles City red-light district who screams slurs at the gays and tells them “To hell you go!” Us gays just want to be able to express ourselves freely and thus, I offer this proposal. I propose to banish all homophobic behavior for the gays to freely express ourselves without the homophobes raining on our parade.

                        The first aspect would be to educate these people. Why do LGBTQ+ people deserve to have access to the same rights the cisgender heterosexual people have access to? Why do LGBTQ+ people deserve to be treated the same way cisgender heterosexual people do? The best way to do this is to start with your close relatives and friends – be sure to educate them about the LGBTQ+ Community and topics like such. Tackle discussions and topics which are commonly brought up in daily events. Moreover, we could share infographics and other useful learning materials that are about the LGBTQ+ Community. These are usually provided by artists and National Democratic Mass Organizations – to name one, Bahaghari. Additionally, graphics serve as simple, eye-easy, informative instruments in bridging the gap between homophobic people’s mindsets and openness.

                        Secondly, we should send the parents, guardians, and “friends” of our LGBTQ+ buddies who decided to send them to conversion therapy to conversion therapy! Simple and easy. This plan can start with my generation being the initiators; I know a good number of people who are part of the LGBTQ+ community who aspire to become doctors, including me. Additionally, there are also LGBTQ+ doctors whose services are available in converting these homophobes into homosexuals! One of these doctors would be James Doble, a psychologist whose studies currently revolve around relationships and SOGIE.

                        Finally, we would have to be to skin the homophobes who rip the wigs off of our folk's heads. They should feel the way we do when we’re invalidated and balded for the sake of our “masculinity” or our “holiness” – what’s a better way than to make them experience the pain firsthand? We could start little – using a small potato peeler to peel their skin off. After that, we can utilize bigger, sharper weapons to continue the process. Fun, isn’t it? To finally experience the pleasure of knowing we aren’t the only ones who understand our pain, to finally know that they get what they deserve.

                        I close this proposal with a few restatements. We shall educate as much as we can. We shall convert those who refuse. We shall skin those who persist. These aspects are the best options for a better country with a happy community wherein heterosexuals and the LGBTQ+ people bond and coexist together. After all, the best way to rid is to eliminate, especially those who persist. The best way to achieve harmony is to put to rest unneeded instruments.
